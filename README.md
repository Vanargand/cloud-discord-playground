# cloud-discord-playground
Just a small playground for messing around with various cloud providers' container capabilities

# Notes
## GCP
* Google Cloud Run seems really cool
* Unfortunately the terraform provider and sdk for GCP does not yet support the necessary objects to get something running without manual console clicking
###Requirements
* Requires Google Cloud SDK
* GCloud Tools for Powershell
* `gcloud components install beta`
* Docker

## Azure
* need to check out azure service plans
